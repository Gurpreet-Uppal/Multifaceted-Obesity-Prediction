Multifaceted Obesity Prediction is a project to analyze how different factors such as body weight, height, and calorie intake tell us the level of obesity the patient is suffering from. After the analysis, the level of obesity is predicted for unseen patients using various machine learning models. Through different modeling methods, we successfully predicted the obesity level with an accuracy of 89%.
